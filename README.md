# SabotAI 
Implementation of an Outdoor Camera Sabotage Detection System Model using Deep Learning

## 🔍 Overview
This project introduces an **AI-powered camera tamper monitoring system** for **outdoor surveillance**.  
It uses **deep learning** to detect common tampering events such as:
- 🔄 **Changes in camera orientation**
- 🔍 **Defocusing**
- 🚧 **Occlusion (blocking the camera view)**

The system provides **real-time monitoring** via a **user-friendly web portal** and sends **SMS alerts** upon tampering detection.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Deep Learning-Based Detection** – Uses **CNN models** to detect tampering.  
✅ **Multi-Camera Support** – Handles multiple camera sources.  
✅ **Real-Time Processing** – Detects issues instantly.  
✅ **Web Dashboard** – Provides visual feedback.  
✅ **SMS Alerts** – Sends notifications on tampering events.
